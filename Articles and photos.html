                          <p>Possibly one of my favourite photos I've ever taken. I used this photo for the art on a story I was doing for Glue Magazine. Originally the article was supposed to be online only but due to some other late submissions this article was featured in the print edition of the magazine as well. Below is a link to the story.</p>

                          <p>I used this piece for an article I did as a student at Algonquin College. I was writing for the journalism programs in house magazine. This specific article was about the growing e-sports community in Ottawa and where students could go if they were interested in it. For the art I got the idea of creating an old looking videogame map showing all the locations referenced in the story.Below is a link to the story.</p>
