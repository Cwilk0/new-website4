            <p>I used this piece for an article I did as a student at Algonquin College. I was writing for the journalism programs in house magazine. This specific article was about the growing e-sports community in Ottawa and where students could go if they were interested in it. For the art I got the idea of creating an old looking videogame map showing all the locations referenced in the story.</p>
